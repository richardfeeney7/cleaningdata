# DataCleaning
Practice Data Cleaning Using Python and Pandas In this dataset I will practice cleaning methods. According to IBM Data Scientists will spend 80% of the time will be spent cleaning the data

Here’s some typical reasons why data is missing:
User forgot to fill in a field. Data was lost while transferring manually from a legacy database. There was a programming error. Users chose not to fill out a field tied to their beliefs about how the results would be used or interpreted.
This is a much smaller dataset than what you’ll typically work with on a daily basis but it highlights a lot of real-world situations that we can expect to encounter on projects.
